## Install

The first of three steps is installing Windmill via npm:

```sh title=Terminal
npm install windmill-react-ui
```

## Add to Tailwind

The second step is to add Windmill to your Tailwind configuration file as a plugin. If you don't have Tailwind configured yet, [see the docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).

```js title=tailwind.config.js
const windmillPlugin = require('windmill-react-ui/plugin')

module.exports = {
  purge: [],
  theme: {},
  variants: {},
  plugins: [windmillPlugin()],
}
```

## Usage

The last step is to add it to your React project, enclosing your root component with the component `Windmill`.

```jsx title=App.js
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import { Windmill } from 'windmill-react-ui'

ReactDOM.render(
  <Windmill>
    <App />
  </Windmill>,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
```
